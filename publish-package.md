#### To publish an npm package on GitHub with GitHub Actions (GHA), you need to ensure that your package.json file has the necessary metadata and configuration. Here are some of the key things you need to check and/or add in your package.json file:


1. name: The name of your package as it will appear on the npm registry.

2. version: The version number of your package.

3. description: A brief description of your package.

4. keywords: An array of keywords to help users find your package on the npm registry.

repository: The URL of the repository where your package's source code is hosted. For GitHub, this will be in the format `"repository": "username/repo"`.

license: The license under which your package is released.

main: The entry point of your package, usually the main moduleAlso include publishConfig
```
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/@scope_of_work"
  }
```


Add GHA workflow: Create a new workflow file `(e.g., .github/workflows/npm-publish.yml)` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your GitHub repository. Here is an example workflow file:

```name: Publish package to GitHub Packages
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Setup .npmrc file to publish to GitHub Packages
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
          # Defaults to the user or organization that owns the workflow file
          scope: '@scope_of_work'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
The above workflow will publish a npm package on GitHub whenever we merge or push the code in the `develop` branch.
